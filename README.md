# Rube Goldberg Project


Name: Grace Montoya
Time to complete: ~12 hours
Thing I liked: The assets were already created and inside the scene.
Thing that was challenging: Understanding the project itself, I didn't understand the proyect until I saw a video on the forums.

Please test this with a Vive.
The ball turns red when it's released from outside of the platform bounds.
If the ball is red it can't collide with the stars, making it impossible to finish the level.
The player can grab the ball and take it back to the platform or throw it on the ground to reset it.
